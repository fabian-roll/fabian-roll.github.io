I am currently working as a Software Constultant at [TNG Technology Consulting](https://www.tngtech.com), where I am developing and managing internal AI-systems on self-hosted GPU servers.

I obtained my [doctoral degree](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/node?id=1735012) in mathematics at the Technical University of Munich. During that time, I also organized the [research seminar](https://collab.dvb.bayern/spaces/TUMtopology/pages/67379386/Applied+Topology+Seminar) of the Applied and Computational Topology group and the [TopMath](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studiengaenge/topmath/) talk series.
